    "## Introduction\n",
    "Biodiversity is the variety of all life on Earth from micro-organisms through plant and animal species (World health Organisation (WHO), 2025). Each species plays a role in maintaining ecosystems by providing specific ecosystem services, and the more species within a community, the healthier that community is (Pavid, n.d.). However, species and ecosystems are fragile and changes to the environment can have detrimental effects on the strength and condition of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insect order *lepidoptera* consists of butterflies and moths, important pollinators that contribute to plant reproduction and ecosystem health and resilience (Baral et. al., 2025). Many *lepidopteran* species have specialised habitats or host plants and are well-studied, making them highly susceptible to change (Carus & Carneiro, 2024) and useful as diversity indicators (Barkmann et.al., 2025). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how to map biodiversity for butterflies and moths in Northern Ireland (NI) between 2014 and 2024, using open data from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Atlas, collected by citizen scientists. The aim of the study is to visualise areas with high species richness and assess biodiversity patterns, helping inform conservation and land management efforts.  \n",
    "The project uses `python` in `jupyter` notebook to process, clean and analyse *lepidoptera* occurrence data, and to create species richness maps. "

    "## Methods\n",
    "Analysis was carried out in `jupyter` notebook using a `python` script environment. The workflow includes data collection, pre-processing, map creation and species diversity analysis using Simpson's Diversity Index (SDI). A list of dependencies is detailed in *Setting up the Conda Environment* section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection \n",
    "Necessary `python` dependencies were added to `jupyter` using `import` statements, to enable data manipulation, geospatial analysis and visualisation.\n",
    "A custom fuction was defined to assign EPSG code 4326 to GeoDataFrames if the value was not set, then to reproject the data to the target EPSG:32629, suitable for analysis within Northern Ireland, to ensure all dataframes have a consistent CRS when added to the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets were loaded into the notebook using:\n",
    "- `geopandas.read_file()` for vector data (**.shp**'s)\n",
    "- `pandas.read_csv` for the species occurence dataset **.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Processing\n",
    "Other functions were defined:\n",
    "- `generate_handles()` for legend creation\n",
    "- `scale_bar()` to add scale bar to maps\n",
    "- `simpsons_diversity()` for calculating biodiversity\n",
    "\n",
    "The *lepidoptera* **.csv** file was transformed into a spatial dataset by creating a geometry column from X/Y coordinates (latitude/longitude). Converting into a `GeoDataFrame` and reprojected to match the UTM Zone 29 projection (EPSG:32629). Further unnecessary columns were removed or renamed to standardise the dataset, then saved as a **.shp** for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Map Creation\n",
    "To visualise the data, a figure and axis object were created using `matplotlib`. The CRS for all layers was set to UTM Zone 29, and map extent defined using the total bounds of the NI outline geometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Features were added to the map using `add_feature()`:\n",
    "- Polygons using `ShapelyFeature()`\n",
    "- Point data using `ax.plot()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The counties data was assigned different symbology for individual counties, to distinguish each on the map and in the legend. Where unique county names were iterated through in a `for` loop and assigned separate colours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom handles were generated to represent each feature in the legend and added to the map, along with gridlines, a scale bar and town name labels. Saving the final image as a high-resolution image. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Biodiversity Analysis\n",
    "To assess *lepidoptera* biodiversity across Northern Ireland:\n",
    "- The total number of individual species (Species Richness (SR)) was calculated by counting the number of unique species names in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Simpson's Diversity Index** (SDI) was computed to measure species richness and evenness in NI. \n",
    "\n",
    "SDI calculates diversity using the number of species and their abundance. There are three forms of Simpson's Indices, the Dominance Index (D), Diversity Index (1-D) and the Reciprocal Index (1/D), represented by the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpson's Dominance Index (D):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D = \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^s p_i^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpson's Diversity Index (1-D):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1-D = 1 - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^s p_i^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpson's Reciprocal Index (1/D):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1/D = \\frac{1}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^s p_i^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *p<sub>i</sub>* is the proprtion of individuals in species *i* and *s* is the total number of species (Suf, 2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of D measures the probability of same-species draws (Suf, 2024) and falls between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate 1 to a few species, and lower values closer to 0 indicate many equally abundant species. This result is counter-intuitive, so the transformation into 1-D and 1/D is carried out. \n",
    "Subtracting the probability of 1 from D gives greater diversity, higher values. The value of 1-D lies between 0 and 1, where 1 is complete diversity and 0 is complete uniformity (Royal Geographical Society, n.d.). Comparing this value between locations indicates the relative degree of biodiversity between locations. \n",
    "The value of 1/D indicates the total number of species present, with 1 being the lowest value and the number of species being the maximum value (Bobbitt, 2021). Comparing between locations, higher values represent greater diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, species richness and SDI were assessed across the whole of Northern Ireland. Then to further analyse spatial patterns in diversity, the *lepidoptera* dataset had spatial joins applied with the counties GeoDataFrame and the diversity assessment was recalaculated for the smaller regions.
