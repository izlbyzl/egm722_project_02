    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how to map biodiversity hotspots for butterflies and moths in Northern Ireland using open data from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Atlas. The aim of the study is to visualise areas with high species richness and assess biodiversity patterns, helping inform conservation and land management efforts.  \n",
    "The project uses Python to process, clean and analyse lepidoptera occurrence data, and to create species richness maps. The maps will be overlain with protected areas for enhanced ecological insights. "

    "### Python Troubleshooting\n",
    "When writing Python code, error messages and warnings will be frequently experienced and need to be addressed. For an experienced user, the type of error and attached message can help establish the issue, but novices may need to seek further help.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Error Types**\n",
    "- NameError: check variables are defined and cells run\n",
    "- ModuleNotFoundError: check conda environment is correct\n",
    "- AttributeError: usually does not exist, check typos\n",
    "- KeyError: something does not exist, check dataframe columns\n",
    "- UserWarning: will still run code, but alerting to a future issue and suggesting modification  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Troubleshooting\n",
    "Problems will also occur when using git, where information can be lost or wrongly added. There are roll-back methods available in git to help resolve issues such as merge conflicts or restoring deleted branches. Commands that can be used to fix issues (geeksforgeeks, 2024) include:  \n",
    "- *--amend*\n",
    "- *rebase*\n",
    "- *reset*\n",
    "- *revert*\n",
    "- *bisect*\n",
    "To avoid problems using Git, it is good practice to make frequent commits with useful messages and to regularly synchronise the repository (Git Scripts, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Help\n",
    "Useful tips (Python Central, 2022) for writing code include: \n",
    "- use code that already works, look for scripts on Google and modify to suit\n",
    "- print outputs often, checks values are correct\n",
    "- run code after each change, makes errors easier to find\n",
    "- read error message and search for online\n",
    "- ask for help, there are many forums [StackOverflow, 2025](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) being popular."
